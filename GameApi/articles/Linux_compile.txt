Requirements before compiling:
  apt-get install g++
  apt-get install git
  apt-get install make
  apt-get install libsdl2-dev
  apt-get install libsdl2-mixer-dev
  apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev
  apt-get install libfreetype6-dev

How to compile the code from scratch:

  mkdir GameApi
  cd GameApi
  git clone https://github.com/terop2/GameApi.git

Then you need to compile it:
  cd GameApi
  make -j 4

This should produce libgameapi.so file

Then final steps are as follows:
  cd editor
  make -f Makefile.Linux

This should produce a.out file which is the gameapi builder, and you can
execute the builder using:
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.. ./a.out
